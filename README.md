## Objective
The problem at hand is that of a bank manager who is faced with an increasing number of customers cancelling their credit card accounts. In order to prevent further loss of customers, the bank manager requires a model that is able to predict the customers that are going to cancel their credit cards so that they can be encouraged to retain instead of cancelling.
